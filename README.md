## ⚙️ Core Capabilities

This utility automates complex registry and file-system operations to ensure a clean digital footprint.

### 🔐 1. Hardware Identity Randomization
* **Physical Address (MAC):** Modifies the Network Adapter address directly via the Windows Registry to prevent hardware-based tracking.
* **Volume Serial Masking:** Generates and applies new Volume Serial Numbers (VSN) to storage drives.

### 🧹 2. Deep Trace Elimination
* **Telemetry Purge:** Removes tracking cookies, local storage, and logs from all major browsers (Chrome, Edge, Opera, Firefox).
* **Application Sanitization:** Specifically targets and removes persistent trace files (such as `.RBXID` and heavy log files) often used for cross-account correlation.

### 🌐 3. Network Stack Reconfiguration
* **Winsock Reset:** Completely reinitializes the Windows Socket API to clear persistent connection data.
* **DNS Flush:** Purges the local DNS resolver cache.

## ⚠️ Critical Prerequisites

Before executing the software, ensure your system meets these requirements:

1.  **Administrative Privileges:** The tool modifies sensitive Registry keys and requires **"Run as Administrator"** to function.
2.  **Antivirus Exclusion:**
    * *Notice:* This application is protected with **ConfuserEx** to prevent reverse engineering.
    * **Result:** Windows Defender and other AVs may flag this as a "False Positive" (often labeled as `Obfuscat` or `Generic`). **You must add an exclusion or allow the file to run.**
3.  **VPN Requirement (Mandatory):**
    * This tool sanitizes your **Hardware**.
    * You **MUST** use a high-quality VPN to sanitize your **IP Address** immediately after the reboot.
